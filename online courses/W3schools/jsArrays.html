<h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
//Javascript Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Spaces and line breaks are not important it is a must to use a comma
var a = ["Saab","Volvo","BMW"];
var a1 = new Array("Saab","Volvo","BMW");//We can use new Array to declare the array
//new is a keyword of JavaScript

// Accessing the Elements of an Array
var b = a[0];
//changing an Array Elements
var cars = ["Saab","Volvo","BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";

//Arrays are Object:
/*Arrays are a special type of objects.
 The typeof operator in JS returns object for arrays.
 Array uses numbers to access
 where objects use names to access its "members"*/
var c = ["John","Doe",46];
var c1 = c[2];

//objects declaration
var person = {firstName:"John" ,lastName:"Doe",age:46};
var d = person.firstName;

//Array Elements Can be Objects
/*Definition:
JavaScript variables can be objects. arrays are special
kind of objects.
*/

//Array Properties and Mehtods
/*The real strenth of JavaScript arrats are the built-in
array properties and methods*/
var e = a.length; //Here length is a property
var e1 = a.sort(); //Sort is a method

//The length Property
/*The length property is always one more than the
higest are index. that means if the highest array index is
2 then length will be 3*/

//Accessing the First Array Element
var fruits =["Banana","Orange","Apple","Mango"];
var first = fruits[0];

//Accessing the Last Array Element
var last = fruits[fruits.length -1]; //Great way fruits.length-1

//Looping Array Elements
/*The safest way to loop through an array, is using
a for loop*/

var f,flen,f1,i;
f =["Banana","Orange","Apple","Mango"];
flen = f.length;
f1 = "<ul>";
//for(i = 0;i){}



//Adding Array Elements
var g = ["Banana","Orange","Apple"];
var g1 = g.push("kiwi\n");
/*New elements can also be added using the length property*/

var g2 = g[g.length];



//Associative Arrays

//The Difference Between Arrays and Objects

//When to Use Arrys. When to use Objects

//AVoid new Array()
var points = [40,100,1,5,25];



//How to recognize an Array

/////outPut
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a+"<hr>"+a1+"<hr>"+b
+"<hr>"+cars+"<hr>"+c1+"<hr>"+d+"<hr>"+e+"<hr>"+e1+"<hr>"+first+"<hr>"+last
+"<hr />"+ g + g1 +"<hr />"+points;
